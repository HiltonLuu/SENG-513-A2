- It was nice learning how to manually manipulate the DOM using vanilla JavaScript. I've never had to do it before.
- Manipulating the DOM manually though a bit verbose, is very powerful with the way that i can dynamically add and remove styles, as well as how you can instantly retrieve different html tags using the functions.
- it gives me more perspective as to how much using modern frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue improves our quality of life as developers.
- Having to manually keep track of state and re-rendering was really tedious and required a lot of helper functions, when react deals with a lot of it under the hood.
- creating a turn based strategy game turned out to be quite complex. Accounting for special abilities of units and combat rules turned out to take quite a bit of time
